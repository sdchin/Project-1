# Horizons (July 2024 -- ?)
## Summary
*Project summary, goals, results.*

Horizons (preliminary name) is a web-based application designed to promote users to try out **new things they've never done before**. Users can create an account and receive **personalized suggestions** based on their goals, previous experiences, and the experiences of users similar to them. Over time, Horizons users can track the bountiful experiences they've accumulated with **eye-catching visualizations**. Horizons is designed with the philosophy of self-improvement in mind, encouraging our users to **break out of routine** and to broaden their horizons.

Built with xyz technologies.
## Background
*Context, preceding events, current state of affairs.*

As we get older, we tend to stay stuck in our old habits and ways. We fall into the same routines. We don't venture out to try new things that we've never done before. If we don't do new things, life can get boring. It can also prevent us from overcoming our problems that we approach with the same mindset we've had for a long time.

It pays to be a well rounded person. It can improve your happiness. Broadening your horizons is a good way to be able to form better connections with others and empathize with them. Having many different experiences under your belt provides a tool kit for tackling your problems in new and innovative ways, allowing you to come up with creative ways to overcome your issues.
## Problem
*Heart of the matter, pain points, user needs.*

Often the hardest step in expanding one's horizons is coming up with new ideas and activities to do. How can someone imagine something that they don't know about? How can, for example, someone who struggles to manage their stress levels come to the realization that crocheting might just be the thing they needed all along? In many cases, people don't even realize that they're stuck in the same old routines and habits, and that trying something new can open up new doors for them. Feeling stuck in a rut and the same old problems can cause feelings of frustration, sadness, boredom, and other negative feelings, potentially creating a negative feedback loop that feels impossible to break free from. 
## Solution
*Method or process, explain how solution solves the problem. Detail each step, decision made, ideation sketches/wireframes/prototypes/personas/etc, project timeline. Competitive analysis of other services, user testing.*

Horizons aims to alleviate this problem by simplifying the hardest part of the equation: coming up with new ideas. By leveraging the power of generative AI, Horizons offers users concrete, actionable suggestions based on individual needs and goals, taking the burden of brainstorming off of the user.
